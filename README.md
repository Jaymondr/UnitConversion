# UnitConversion
SwiftUI solo project that challenges my newly developed skills.
Converts the given input into the chosen unit, whether that be Fahrenheit, or Celsius. Shows the result above a 
segmented Picker view, so the user can easily change the output unit. To make it more clear to the user what unit 
is being converted there is a computed property string displayed next to the 'Input Temperature' header that 
shows either ℃ or ℉, so it's clear what input unit is.
